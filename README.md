# Closet - Backend

Last summer after once more relocation, I realize I didn't know where are some of my clothes, since I have them in different parts of home, at my parent's home, etc... So, I want to register each piece of clothes, accesories and shoes giving them characteristics as well as a location. The idea is to have a filter with several options to find the item quickly by colour, season, location, etc... In addition, there will be a part in which the user can manage the borrowings, how many times you have lent something but you can't remember who has it, when you lent it or if your friend returned it?
